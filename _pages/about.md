I'm a biological anthropologist interested in how microbes can help us better understand human evolution, health, history, behavior, and diversity. My research is focused on the interaction between cross-kingdom microbes in diverse host species including humans, non-human primates, and insect disease vectors. I study both living and archaeological populations to better understand how host associated microbial communities have changed over time. 

Bioinformatician and mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Currently a postdoc at Clemson University studying oral microbiota in children with HIV.
