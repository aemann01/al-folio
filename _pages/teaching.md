##### Courses

* **Plagues and People** (University of Oklahoma ANTH 1913): In this course students learn about the impact of diseases such as rabies, plague, smallpox, polio, measles, and HIV on human society - from their effects on populations to how they have influenced the course of history. In this course we identify social and cultural factors and conditions that influence and impede the rate and spread of contagious diseases as well as ethical issues that arise concerning the treatment of the sick and policies designed to halt epidemics.
