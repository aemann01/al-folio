  abstract={The oral microbiome plays key roles in human biology, health, and disease, but little is known about the global diversity, variation, or evolution of this microbial community. To better understand the evolution and changing ecology of the human oral microbiome, we analysed 124 dental biofilm metagenomes from humans, including Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene to present-day modern humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, as well as New World howler monkeys for comparison. We find that a core microbiome of primarily biofilm-structural taxa has been maintained throughout African hominid evolution, and these microbial groups are also shared with howler monkeys, suggesting that they have been important oral members since before the catarrhine-platyrrhine split ca. 40 million years ago. However, community structure and individual microbial phylogenies do not closely reflect host relationships, and the dental biofilms of Homoand chimpanzees are distinguished by major taxonomic and functional differences. Reconstructing oral metagenomes up to 100 thousand years ago, we show that the microbial profiles of both Neanderthals and modern humans are highly similar, sharing functional adaptations in nutrient metabolism. These include an apparent Homo-specific acquisition of salivary amylase-binding capability by oral streptococci, suggesting microbial co-adaptation with host diet. We additionally find evidence of shared genetic diversity in the oral bacteria of Neanderthal and Upper Palaeolithic modern humans that is not observed in later modern human populations. Differences in the oral microbiomes of African hominids provide insights into human evolution, the ancestral state of the human microbiome, and a temporal framework for understanding microbial health and disease.},

  title={The adult phenylketonuria (PKU) gut microbiome},
  author={Mancilla, V.J., and Mann, A.E., and Zhang, Y., and Allen, M.S.},
  abstract={Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of phenylalanine metabolism primarily treatedthrough a phenylalanine-restrictive diet that is frequently supplemented with an amino acid formulato maintain proper nutrition.  Little is known of the effects of these dietary interventions on thegut microbiome of PKU patients, particularly in adults. In this study, we sequenced the V4 regionof the 16S rRNA gene from stool samples collected from adults with PKU (n= 11) and non-PKUcontrols (n= 21). Gut bacterial communities were characterized through measurements of diversityand taxa abundance. Additionally, metabolic imputation was performed based on detected bacteria.Gut community diversity was lower in PKU individuals, though this effect was only statisticallysuggestive.  A total of 65 genera across 5 phyla were statistically differentially abundant betweenPKU and control samples (p< 0.001). Additionally, we identified six metabolic pathways that differedbetween groups (p< 0.05), with four enriched in PKU samples and two in controls. While the childPKU gut microbiome has been previously investigated, this is the first study to explore the gutmicrobiome of adult PKU patients. We find that microbial diversity in PKU children differs from PKUadults and highlights the need for further studies to understand the effects of dietary restrictions.},

  author={Mann, A.E., and Fellows Yates, J.A., and Fagern\"{a}s, Z., and Austin, R.M., and Nelson, E.A., and Hofman, C.A.},
  abstract={Dental calculus and other preserved microbiome substrates are an attractive target for dietary reconstruction in past populations through a variety of physical, chemical, and molecular means. Recently, studies have attempted to reconstruct diet from archaeological dental calculus using archaeogenetic techniques. While dental calculus may provide a relatively stable environment for DNA preservation, the detection of plants and animals possibly consumed by an individual through DNA analysis is primarily hindered by microbial richness and incomplete reference databases. Moreover, high genomic similarity within eukaryotic groups - such as mammals - can obfuscate precise taxonomic identification. In the current study we demonstrate the challenges associated with accurate taxonomic identification and authentication of dietary taxa in ancient DNA data using both synthetic and ancient dental calculus datasets. We highlight common errors and sources of contamination across ancient DNA datasets, provide recommendations for dietary DNA validation, and call for caution in the interpretation of diet from dental calculus and other archaeological microbiome substrates.},

  title={Comparison of the Bacterial Gut Microbiome of North American Trypanosoma spp. With and Without Trypanosoma cruzi},
  author={Mann, A.E., and Mitchell, E.A., and Zhang, Y., and Curtis-Robles, R., and Thapa, S., and Hamer, S.A., and Allen, M.S.},
  abstract={Chagas disease, caused by the hemoflagellate protist Trypanosoma cruzi, affects nearly 6 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America. Hematophagous triatomine insects (“kissing bugs”) are the primary vectors of T. cruzi throughout the Americas and feed on a variety of animals, including humans. Control of triatomines is central to the control of T. cruzi infection. Recent advances in mitigation of other insect-borne diseases via the manipulation of insect-associated bacteria as a way to halt or slow disease transmission has opened questions to the applicability of these methods to Chagas disease vectors. Few studies have examined the hindgut microbiome of triatomines found in North America. In the current study, two species of triatomines were collected across Texas, United States, screened for the presence of T. cruzi, and analyzed for the bacterial composition of their hindguts using a 16S rRNA gene-fragment metabarcoding approach. We compared diversity of microbial community profiles across 74 triatomine insects to address the hypothesis that the richness and abundance of bacterial groups differ by T. cruzi infection and strain type, blood meal engorgement status, insect species, sex, and collection location. The gut microbial community of individual triatomines was characterized by low intraindividual taxonomic diversity and high interindividual variation that was weakly predicted by triatomine species, and was not predicted by triatomine sex, collection location, T. cruzi infection status, or blood meal score. However, we did find bacterial groups enriched in T. cruzi-positive individuals, including Enterobacterales, and Petrimonas. Additionally, we detected Salmonella enterica subspecies diarizonae in three triatomine individuals; this species is commonly associated with reptiles and domesticated animals and is a pathogen of humans. These data suggest that Triatoma spp. in Texas have variable patterns of colonized and transient bacteria, and may aid in development of novel means to interfere with transmission of the Chagas disease parasite T. cruzi. Deeper understanding of the effects of parasite infection on diverse insect vector microbiomes may highlight disease transmission risk and facilitate discovery of possible intervention strategies for biological control of this emerging vector-borne disease of global health significance.},

  abstract={Documenting the natural diversity of eukaryotic organisms in the nonhuman primate (NHP) gut is important for understanding the evolution of the mammalian gut microbiome, its role in digestion, health and disease, and the consequences of anthropogenic change on primate biology and conservation. Despite the ecological significance of gut-associated eukaryotes, little is known about the factors that influence their assembly and diversity in mammals. In this study, we used an 18S rRNA gene fragment metabarcoding approach to assess the eukaryotic assemblage of 62 individuals representing 16 NHP species. We find that cercopithecoids, and especially the cercopithecines, have substantially higher alpha diversity than other NHP groups. Gut-associated protists and nematodes are widespread among NHPs, consistent with their ancient association with NHP hosts. However, we do not find a consistent signal of phylosymbiosis or host-species specificity. Rather, gut eukaryotes are only weakly structured by primate phylogeny with minimal signal from diet, in contrast to previous reports of NHP gut bacteria. The results of this study indicate that gut-associated eukaryotes offer different information than gut-associated bacteria and add to our understanding of the structure of the gut microbiome.},

  abstract={Dental calculus is among the richest known sources of ancient DNA in the archaeological record. Although most DNA within calculus is microbial, it has been shown to contain sufficient human DNA for the targeted retrieval of whole mitochondrial genomes. Here, we explore whether calculus is also a viable substrate for whole human genome recovery using targeted enrichment techniques. Total DNA extracted from 24 paired archaeological human dentin and calculus samples was subjected to whole human genome enrichment using in‐solution hybridization capture and high‐throughput sequencing. Total DNA from calculus exceeded that of dentin in all cases, and although the proportion of human DNA was generally lower in calculus, the absolute human DNA content of calculus and dentin was not significantly different. Whole genome enrichment resulted in up to four‐fold enrichment of the human endogenous DNA content for both dentin and dental calculus libraries, albeit with some loss in complexity. Recovering more on‐target reads for the same sequencing effort generally improved the quality of downstream analyses, such as sex and ancestry estimation. For nonhuman DNA, comparison of phylum‐level microbial community structure revealed few differences between precapture and postcapture libraries, indicating that off‐target sequences in human genome‐enriched calculus libraries may still be useful for oral microbiome reconstruction. While ancient human dental calculus does contain endogenous human DNA sequences, their relative proportion is low when compared with other skeletal tissues. Whole genome enrichment can help increase the proportion of recovered human reads, but in this instance enrichment efficiency was relatively low when compared with other forms of capture. We conclude that further optimization is necessary before the method can be routinely applied to archaeological samples.},

  abstract={Dental calculus (calcified dental plaque) is prevalent in archaeological skeletal collections and is a rich source of oral microbiome and host-derived ancient biomolecules. Recently, it has been proposed that dental calculus may provide a more robust environment for DNA preservation than other skeletal remains, but this has not been systematically tested. In this study, shotgun-sequenced data from paired dental calculus and dentin samples from 48 globally distributed individuals are compared using a metagenomic approach. Overall, we find DNA from dental calculus is consistently more abundant and less contaminated than DNA from dentin. The majority of DNA in dental calculus is microbial and originates from the oral microbiome; however, a small but consistent proportion of DNA (mean 0.08 ± 0.08%, range 0.007–0.47%) derives from the host genome. Host DNA content within dentin is variable (mean 13.70 ± 18.62%, range 0.003–70.14%), and for a subset of dentin samples (15.21%), oral bacteria contribute > 20% of total DNA. Human DNA in dental calculus is highly fragmented, and is consistently shorter than both microbial DNA in dental calculus and human DNA in paired dentin samples. Finally, we find that microbial DNA fragmentation patterns are associated with guanine-cytosine (GC) content, but not aspects of cellular structure.},

  abstract={To date, characterization of ancient oral (dental calculus) and gut (coprolite) microbiota has been primarily accomplished through a metataxonomic approach involving targeted amplification of one or more variable regions in the 16S rRNA gene. Specifically, the V3 region (E. coli 341–534) of this gene has been suggested as an excellent candidate for ancient DNA amplification and microbial community reconstruction. However, in practice this metataxonomic approach often produces highly skewed taxonomic frequency data. In this study, we use non-targeted (shotgun metagenomics) sequencing methods to better understand skewed microbial profiles observed in four ancient dental calculus specimens previously analyzed by amplicon sequencing. Through comparisons of microbial taxonomic counts from paired amplicon (V3 U341F/534R) and shotgun sequencing datasets, we demonstrate that extensive length polymorphisms in the V3 region are a consistent and major cause of differential amplification leading to taxonomic bias in ancient microbiome reconstructions based on amplicon sequencing. We conclude that systematic amplification bias confounds attempts to accurately reconstruct microbiome taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA V3 amplicon data generated using universal primers. Because in silico analysis indicates that alternative 16S rRNA hypervariable regions will present similar challenges, we advocate for the use of a shotgun metagenomics approach in ancient microbiome reconstructions.},
