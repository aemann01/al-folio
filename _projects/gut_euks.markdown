The mammalian gut microbiome is home to a variety of microorganisms from all kingdoms of life (and viruses too!). The assembly, structure, and stability of these microbial communities is shaped by host gut physiology, diet, phylogeny, host age, geography, and social behaviors. Our current understanding of gut microbial communities is shaped by a disproportionate focus on the role of bacteria but micro- and macroeukaryotes also shape the community through predation, resource competition, and interaction with the host immune system. I'm interested in how these ecosystems evolved in humans and our closest non-human primate relatives.
